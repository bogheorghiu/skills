# layer-parity.test.sh — fails when the gate's layers drift apart.
#
# WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. A review of this gate returned four findings, and every one of them was the
# same defect wearing a different hat: a component was hardened and its sibling was not, so the two
# stopped agreeing. The secret-overwrite tool searched two directories while pre-push searched
# three. pre-commit
# scanned without the flags that stop a `.gitattributes` line from blanking the diff. .gitignore
# covered one of the two filenames the hooks accept. None of these was a flaw in any component's own
# logic, and none of them was findable by testing a component on its own.
#
# The reason the drift happened is that nothing was checking. Each layer was hardened by hand, so
# parity survived only as long as whoever edited one remembered to edit the others — and that memory
# is exactly what a repo does not have. This file is the thing that remembers.
#
# The checks DERIVE from .githooks/pre-push wherever they can, instead of restating its rules. That
# distinction is the whole point: a check that hard-codes "the two filenames are .local and .txt" is
# a third copy of the rule and drifts like the first two. A check that reads the filenames out of
# pre-push cannot disagree with pre-push — it can only report that somebody else does.
#
# Run: bash .githooks/layer-parity.test.sh   (also runs in CI; see pii-denylist-guard.yml)
