# Verify a skill change at the level it needs, and say which level ran

A skill is code that a model executes, so a change to its prose can break a run as surely as a code change. CI cannot see that: it checks structure and scripts, not whether an agent reading the new text still asks before spending the user's money.

Three levels, cheapest first:

1. **Structural.** `python3 .github/scripts/check_skills.py` and `python3 skills/trip-scout/scripts/sources.py check`. Enough for a typo or a source entry backed by a run.
2. **Blind review.** A fresh agent with no context from your session reads the whole skill folder against a bar written down before it starts: BLOCKING means following the files would plausibly give the user a wrong result, break a law or a service's policy, or fail the run. Ask open questions ("what does an agent do at step 4?"), never "confirm that step 4 now asks", because a reviewer told the expected answer finds it. Needed for any change to `SKILL.md`, a pattern, or `reference/legal.md`.
3. **Live run.** A real trip, end to end, with a real connector. The only level that shows whether actors, schemas and prices behave as the entries claim.

In the PR, name the highest level you ran and what it could not see. "CI is green" for a prose change means level 1 only. A reviewer's disagreement with you goes to the owner as it stands; do not quietly reconcile it.
